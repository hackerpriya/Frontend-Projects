    <h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Hotarubi no Mori e</h3>
    <p>This movie was about a girl named Hotaru and a boy named Gin. I loved this movie because it conveyed the unconditional love between Hotaru and Gin, as Gin was forbidden to touch humans. This movie teaches about true love.</p>
    <h3>White Snake</h3>
    <p>It's a story about a female white snake named Blanca and a human boy named Xuan. I loved this movie because Xuan loved Blanca unconditionally, even after knowing that she was considered a demon by people. When Xuan dies, Blanca waits for him to be reborn just to meet him again. This movie teaches us that no matter how many years pass, someone can wait forever.</p>
    <h3>Aladdin</h3>
    <p>It's the story of a kind-hearted thief named Aladdin who encounters a Genie and genuinely befriends him. Aladdin is granted three wishes, and after having two of his wishes fulfilled by the Genie, he selflessly chooses to set the Genie free so that he can live a normal life. Aladdin's decision to prioritize the Genie's freedom over his own greed is a stark departure from the behavior of past owners, none of whom ever made such a wish for him.It gives us lesson to be kind and selfless in friendship.</p>
